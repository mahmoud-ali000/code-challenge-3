Movie Ticket Sales
This project is a simple movie ticket sales website that fetches data from an API and displays movies that are available for purchase. The website also allows customers to buy tickets for the movies they are interested in, with a display of the available tickets decreasing in real-time as tickets are bought.

Technologies Used
This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also makes use of the Fetch API to retrieve data from the movie API.

Usage
To use this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The movies available for purchase will be displayed in a list, with details about each movie including the poster image, title, description, runtime, showtime, and the number of available tickets.

To purchase a ticket, simply click the "Buy ticket" button. If there are no more tickets available, an alert will be displayed indicating that the ticket is sold out.

Future Improvements
This project is a simple example of how to create a movie ticket sales website with real-time updates of the available tickets. Some future improvements that could be made to this project include:

Adding user authentication and registration to allow customers to create accounts and purchase tickets more easily.
Implementing a shopping cart system to allow customers to purchase multiple tickets at once.
Incorporating a payment system to allow customers to pay for their tickets online.
Adding additional features such as reviews, ratings, and recommendations to provide more information about the movies available for purchase.
